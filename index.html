        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>As part of Dr. Mauriello's Sensify lab, I am working on a project to detect stress in computer users by supplementing the use of facial tracking with stored information on the user's interaction with their computer. We want to see if the supplemental data can prevent racial and other biases that come with facial tracking systems.</p>
